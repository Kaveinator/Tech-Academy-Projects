# Javascript Projects
Samples of web projects I built with Vanilla Javascript
 + [Beeper](https://kavemans.dev/tta/beeper?m=10) - A simple app that plays a sound at a certain interval. I used it to keep myself on track (interval configurable via URL query)
 + [Web Calculator](https://kavemans.dev/tta/calc) - A stylized calculator that can do basic operations. [Source Code](./BasicJavascriptProjects/Project12Calculator)
 + [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://kavemans.dev/tta/ttt) - A classic game where you match against the computer. Click on the squares to place your marker, the computer (while sometimes making good moves) selects squares at random. [Source Code](./BasicJavascriptProjects/Project11TicTacToe)
 + [Persistent Todo List](https://kavemans.dev/tta/todo) - A todo web interface that allows you to create and delete tasks. You can also track how long it takes you to complete a task. [Source Code](./BasicJavascriptProjects/Project17TodoApp)
